# OCBC HACK-IT! Submission - Data & AI

This repo was created for OCBC (Singapore) HACK-IT! Hackathon submission.

**Purpose:** In this data science project, I attempt to clean, wrangle, model and visualise US traffic pattners from 2015, with the goal of gathering five different insightful patterns from the data source. I will also discuss my thought process as well as future possible works after my analysis.
